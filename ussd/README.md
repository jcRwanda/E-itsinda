# E-itsinda
e-Itsinda is a digital platform designed to modernize and strengthen Rwanda’s community saving groups (Itsinda / Ibimina). These groups play a crucial role in supporting families—especially mothers, low-income earners, youth, and informal workers—but they still rely on manual notebooks, verbal agreements, and non-standard financial tracking.

This project introduces a transparent, secure, and compliant digital ecosystem that helps saving groups operate efficiently and meet government requirements.

**🚩 Problem**

Many saving groups in communities like Gahanga Sector continue to face challenges such as:

Miscalculations, lost records, and fund misuse

Conflicts and mistrust due to lack of transparency

No proper books of accounts to comply with the Government of Rwanda’s Ibimina registration requirements

Overloaded group leaders handling all records manually

Limited digital access for mothers and members without smartphones

Government policies exist, but no local digital tool helps saving groups record, manage, and submit the required data for compliance.
As a result, many groups remain vulnerable, unregistered, and financially insecure.

**💡 Our Solution**

e-Itsinda provides a community-first digital platform designed to:

Digitize savings, loans, transactions, and attendance

Automate calcuations and prevent human error

Increase transparency and trust among members

Enable compliance with national Ibimina registration standards

Generate simple digital reports for leaders

Support both mobile app and USSD for mothers and members without smartphones

(Upcoming) Integrate blockchain for secure, tamper-proof financial records

Provide dashboards for promoters, NGOs, and sector-level administrators

We already have an MVP, and the next phase is building a blockchain-enabled version for improved trust and transparency.

**🌍 Why It Matters**

Saving groups are the backbone of community resilience.
Digitalizing them restores:

Financial transparency

Trust between members

Economic security for mothers and vulnerable groups

Compliance with government policies

Starting with Gahanga Sector, this project will scale across Rwanda to support all Ibimina.
